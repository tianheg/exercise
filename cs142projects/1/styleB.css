/* 
   
    Five box elements, lined up horizontally in the top left corner.
    Boxes do not wrap with window resizing (i.e. Boxes A through E should stay on the same line even if your browser window is too small to display them all).
    The last box is positioned in the bottom right corner of the window and stays there even when the window resizes.
    Each box is 100x150 pixels (color: #eeeff2), with a 10px dotted line (color: #D0D0FF) on the left. Boxes are separated by 10 pixels of space.
    When hovering over an box, the cursor changes to a hand and the box and font colors change (colors: yellow, goldenrod, respectively).
    The font in all elements is Tahoma, 40 pixels.
    There are 10 pixels of space between the letters and the edge of the box.
